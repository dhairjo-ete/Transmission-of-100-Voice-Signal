# Transmission-of-100-Voice-Signal
 Design and Simulation of a SSB–FDM Analog Communication System over AWGN Channel for Multi Voice Signals

This project involves the design and simulation of an analog communication system to transmit 100 simultaneous voice signals (each with 4 kHz bandwidth) using Single Sideband (SSB) modulation, Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), and an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. The entire system was implemented and tested in MATLAB Simulink.

Key Features & Achievements:
✅ Designed SSB modulators and demodulators for 100 channels, each assigned unique carrier frequencies to avoid interference
✅ Achieved total bandwidth efficiency of 400 kHz using SSB modulation (bandwidth equal to message signal)
✅ Implemented FDM to multiplex 100 channels without cross-connection via precisely tuned band-pass filters
✅ Use AWGN channel to assess noise resilience and real-world performance
✅ Successfully recovered original signals with minimal distortion — frequency deviation only ~4 Hz due to noise and filter imperfections

Technical Highlights:
🔹 Mathematical modeling of SSB and FDM systems
🔹 MATLAB Simulink implementation with modular subsystem design
🔹 AWGN noise modeling and analysis of channel impact
🔹 Frequency planning for multi-channel analog transmission
